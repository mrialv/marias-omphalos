    <h2>butterfly</h2>

    <pre class="poem-text">

you used to hold a butterfly
by her wing

if too tight,
didn't you think
she might tear?

promises 
that fleet
and are fragile

lights 
that kept the monsters away
but didn't

words 
that meant something
but didn't

hurting is familiar
expressed by shadows
that cling to hands
before they even reach 
for the light

you learn
holding too tight kills
letting go liberates

it'll feel
like tearing
like tearing
like tearing
