    <h2>butterfly</h2>
    <p class="date">february 9, 2026</p>

    <pre class="poem-text">

you held a butterfly by her wing,
if too tight,
didn't you think she might tear?

promises--
fleeting and fragile

lights that kept the monsters away
but didn't

words that meant something
but didn't

hurting is familiar
expressed by shadows
that cling to hands
before they even reach for light

you poke anyway

you learn:
holding too tight kills
letting go teaches

it'll feel like tearing
it'll feel like tearing
it'll feel like tearing
