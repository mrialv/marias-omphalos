    <h2>brown eyes</h2>
    <p class="date">october 29, 2025</p>

    <pre class="poem-text">

under the covers,
a voice presses at my shoulder
but it wears itself thin.

is turning away
the only answer-
to time unregistering itself?

i finally break the ambiance of cold air,
but frozen there,
her dark curls spill.

tracing her belted skin
are strands lining time,
marking the paths i've lost

the scars on her face,
much like the wounds i don't care for,
were kept unscathed.     

imagine the fright when i see
that it's my own brown eyes
staring back at me.
