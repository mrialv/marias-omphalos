    <pre class="poem-text">

an ocean so beautiful,
its blue hues echo among
the hollowing weeps of tides
that clash with one other.

only now the cries surface
as i dive in,
following stabbing pains
of a thousand needles clawing at my skin.

i sink long
before my arms do,
skin that was once warmed,
is now chilled by the very same embrace
