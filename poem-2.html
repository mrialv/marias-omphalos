    <h2>brown eyes</h2>
    <p class="date">may 3, 2024</p>

    <pre class="poem-text">

a voice presses at my shoulder,
but it wears itself thin,
beneath the covers.

the covers i drag over
tranquil waves of oblivion,
i had alreaady succumbed to.

is turning away
the only answer-
to time unregistering itself?

to the ambiance of cold air,
frozen there,
her dark curls spilled,

tracing belted skin
of strands lining the time,
marking my paths lost

the scars on her face,
were kept unscathed.
much like            

imagine the fright when i see
that it's my own brown eyes
staring back at me.
