    <h2>for when you feel like taking shortcuts</h2>
    <p class="date">september 20, 2024</p>

    <pre class="poem-text">

the pyramids pierces the gaze from above,
but not the hands that bleed upon the climb.

it strikes with its blade own of seeing,
and the blood veins through mortar and time

perhaps something to ponder:
consider an ascent
slowed through silence
and fervent heat,

where impatience
is not forgiven;

for the vision that is earned
is much gentler
than the one 
taken by a cheat.
