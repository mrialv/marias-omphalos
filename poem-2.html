    <h2>brown eyes</h2>
    <p class="date">may 3, 2024</p>

    <pre class="poem-text">

a voice presses at my shoulder,
but it wears itself thin,
weighed down by the covers.

the covers i drag over
tranquil waves of oblivion

is turning away
the only answer,
where time unregisters itself?

i finally turn over
after these restless nights,

only to find an empty space,
cold to the touch.

her dark curls spill,
tracing the markings of belted skin,

scars on her face,
kept unscathed

imagine the fright when i see
that it's my own brown eyes
staring right back at me
