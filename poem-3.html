    <h2>for when you feel like taking shortcuts</h2>
    <p class="date">december 18, 2025</p>

    <pre class="poem-text">

the pyramids pierces the gaze from above,
but not the hands that bleed upon the climb.

the gaze strikes with its own of seeing,
satisifed
as blood veins through mortar and time

perhaps a pilgrimage for thought:
consider an ascent
slowed through silence
and fervent heat,

where impatience
is not forgiven;

for the vision that is earned
is much gentler
than the one 
taken by a cheat.
